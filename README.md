Identifying the color of the iPhone 
iPhone 14 Color Recognition using Teachable Machine & Google Colab

This project uses a machine learning model trained with Google's Teachable Machine to recognize the color of an iPhone 14. The model was exported and used in a Google Colab notebook.

üß† Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automatically detect whether an iPhone 14 shown to the camera is Purple or White (Starlight) using a custom-trained image classification model.


üõ† Tools & Technologies
Teachable Machine ‚Äì For training the image classification model
Google Colab ‚Äì For testing and running the model in Python
TensorFlow / Keras ‚Äì For loading and running the model
OpenCV ‚Äì For image input and display
Webcam or Uploaded Images ‚Äì To input images of the iPhone.


üß™ How It Works
A dataset was created with images of iPhone 14 in Purple and White.
The model was trained using Teachable Machine's Image Project.
The trained model was exported and integrated into a Google Colab notebook.
The notebook processes images from a webcam or file upload and predicts the iPhone's color.


‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Open the iPhone14_Color_Recognition.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
Upload or capture an image of the iPhone 14.
The model will predict the color: Purple or White.
